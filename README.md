# Game Prototypes


This is a repository of my work-in-progress and completed game projects. Currently, this repository contains the following projects:

## 1. Hopper

Hopper is a 2D platformer. It is currently available to download through this repository and play on a Windows 11 PC. Currently in the first alpha version.

## 2. TestPlatformer

My first attempt at incorporating different platformer mechanics. This is not currently in the works since I decided to strip down the visual aspect of my platformer, and now we have Hopper instead.

## 3. Top-Down Prototype

This projecy has not been updated on this repository, even though I have a more recent version on the development system. It is a 2D top-down game involving collecting fuel cans and hitting checkpoints.

## 4. Testing

An even older version of the Top-Down Prototype but involves radars and an aircraft. It quickly transformed into the Top-Down Prototype.
